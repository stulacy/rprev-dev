\description{
A dataset in the format of a disease registry, where the outcome being modelled is death
due to the simulated disease. The registry began in January 2003, with 1000 incident cases being
recorded over a period of nearly exactly ten years. The patients are followed up for a further
two years until 17.03.2015, at which point any subjects alive are marked as right censored.
}
\details{
Demographic and disease-specific data required for prevalence estimations are included,
such as sex, age, and dates of entry and event. \code{eventdate} marks the date of the
last known follow-up with the patient, corresponding to death (\code{status = 1}) or
censorship (\code{status = 0}).
